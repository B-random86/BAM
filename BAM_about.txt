Bust a Move Fitness opened in Colville, Wa November 2019. It is uncommon to find such diversity in a rural town of less than 5000. Ashley has always been passionate about encouraging others while making it fun. 


We just opened our bussiness, Bust a Move fitness in Colville Washington, in November. We have had to close from having classes at our location due to the COVID-19 non essential bussines order. We are still having to pay our rent and all bills in order to keep our studio during this time. We want to be able to open back up as soon as this is all over but are worried we will not make it. We are starting to do Youtube videos to give our clients the ability to still workout at home while the Stay at home Stay in place order is in place. We are looking at getting help to pay the expenses of mainting the physical location. so far we are not eligible for any of the loans or grants. We are doing the online videos on youtube to help support the community with workouts at home still in a group setting. Thank you all for the continued support during these hard times we are all going through. We do a wide variety of group fitness classes. Examples are: Pilates, Yoga, Bootcamp, Zumba, Drumsticks +, HIIT, Cardio HipHop, Step, Step and Tone, Just Abs, low impact classes,and more.
